govlab-academy-gallery
======================

Project gallery for the govlab-academy.

The content comes from a CSV file.

The output is generated in `/gen` from the `generate.py` Python script.

You need to install the `yaml` package first.
`sudo pip install pyyaml`

To generate the site, simply run:
`python generate.py`.

And we are using this good example to show people how to use static sites and git.
